      Arteta dismisses ‘bottlers’ talk amid title wobble
    </h1>
    <p style="background-color: red; font-size: 25px">
      Under Arteta, the North London club has finished as the runners-up in
      their last three campaigns. <br />
      “It’s not part of my vocabulary and I don’t see it like this because I
      don’t think anybody wants to do that as an intention," Arteta told
      reporters on Friday, when asked about the term being used regarding their
      latest wobble in the title race. <br />
      “That’s individual opinion, perspective. You have to respect that. That’s
      what I said after in the press conference. You lose two points against
      Wolves in the manner that the game played out, you have to take it on the
      chin. It's part of our role."<br />
      “What I’m very interested in is the next one, what we are made of, what we
      love about this and how we write our own destiny from here.” Arsenal have
      also reached the League Cup final and the round of 16 in the Champions
      League and the FA Cup.
